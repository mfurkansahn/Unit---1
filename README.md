 Easy: [I created stacks, piles or pyramids of obstacles for the vehicle to pass through.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Xsz9rT1kPXwJKjRJuvXmlM3eci23_D18/view?usp=sharing) 


Medium: [I added a few more cars that automatically drive down the road in the opposite direction, which the player must also avoid.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Fzr82Mj9HaGIh7pZGA-MW_zF_7V4SmOI/view?usp=sharing)

Hard: [I allowed the player to press a key on the keyboard to change camera views](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UMU0Ij2Qz6P7GrhxQWthOUiUTfTEKSRn/view?usp=sharing)

Expert: [I turned this into a two-car "local multiplayer" split-screen game where one player's car is controlled by WASD and the other is controlled by the arrow keys](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eYehdjKT3sI9zgUQMqvFtnqM-cDDnGhR/view?usp=sharing)
